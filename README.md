# Microsoft Engage'21 
The project was to create Microsoft Teams clone i.e a working prototype where a minimum of two participants can connect with each other using our product to have a video conversation. Apart from that, I have added other functionalities which allows the user to chat and share the screen during the meeting. The project is built using Agile Methodology. Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprintâ€™s goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints. The Technologies used in this project are React, NodeJS, Express, WebRTC, Socket.io , Simple Peer.
